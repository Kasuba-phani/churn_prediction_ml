# CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION USING ML
Predicting telecom customer churn using ML models.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Contains information on 7,000+ telecom customers.
- Features include: `gender`, `tenure`, `contract`, `internet_service`, `monthly_charges`, `payment_method`, etc.
- Target variable: `Churn`

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key patterns observed:
- Month-to-month customers have the highest churn rate.
- Fiber optic users churn more than DSL users.
- Customers with high monthly charges are more likely to leave.
- Senior citizens and customers with no tech support also show higher churn.

## 🧪 Machine Learning Models

The following models were trained and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Support Vector Machine
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Best performing model:** `XGBoost` with ~92% accuracy.

**Evaluation metrics used:**
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion Matrix
